I am interested in embedded systems engineering. I also love learning more about computer science and engineering topics. In my free time, I enjoy practicing kung fu, going to the gym, and watching movies. You can connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-dhaktode-5a476422a/).
