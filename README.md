## Sahil Dhaktode

**I am a sophomore studying CSE at UCI.**

I am interested in embedded systems engineering. I also love learning more about computer science and engineering topics. I am a strong believer in not being lazy to do what needs to be done, even if it seems difficult. In my free time, I enjoy practicing kung fu, going to the gym, and watching movies.
